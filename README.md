# Python Learning Projects

This repository contains simple Python programs created as part of my learning journey. Each script demonstrates core Python concepts, such as loops, functions, file operations, and error handling.

## Files and Descriptions

### 1. `calculator.py`
- **Description**: A basic calculator program that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Features**:
  - Handles invalid input and prevents crashes.
  - Saves results of all operations to a file (`result.txt`).
  - Demonstrates the use of conditionals, functions, and error handling.

### 2. `advanced_calculator.py`
- **Description**: An enhanced version of the calculator program.
- **Features**:
  - Allows users to retry invalid operations without restarting the program.
  - Uses a loop to allow multiple operations in one session.
  - Appends results to a file without overwriting previous data.

### 3. `temperature_converter.py`
- **Description**: A program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- **Features**:
  - Users can choose between two conversion options.
  - Handles invalid inputs gracefully.
  - Demonstrates the use of functions for modularity.
